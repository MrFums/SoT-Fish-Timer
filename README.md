# SoT-Fish-Timer
A bot that after pressing a key, will make a beep after that amount of time to tell you when your fish is cooked.


You need to have system sounds on for the beeps to work / be audible. 

Run package installer to automatically install the required package (keyboard).

You need to have Python 3+ installed for this program to work.
